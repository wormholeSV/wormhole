What is Wormhole SV
-----------------

Wormhole is a valuable fork that was recently launched on Bitcoin Cash, allowing smart contracts and tokens on Bitcoin (BCH). While this was a somewhat contentious addition to Bitcoin Cash, our small group of developers sit squarely between supporting Wormhole and supporting Bitcoin SV, big blocks, along with following the insight and strength of Satoshi's Vision. While many, including Satoshi himself, feel that burning BCH to create WHC is a problem. We feel there is much to be explored in launching Wormhole on Bitcoin SV and look forward to working with BitcoinSV in creating Wormhole on Satoshio's Vision of Bitcoin. 

Wormhole SV is a fast, portable Omni Layer implementation that is based off [Bitcoin SV](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv/). This implementation requires no external dependencies extraneous to Bitcoin SV, and is native to the Bitcoin Cash network just like other Bitcoin Cash nodes. It currently supports a wallet mode and is seamlessly available on three platforms: Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Wormhole Cash Layer extensions are exposed via the JSON-RPC interface. Development has been consolidated on the Wormhole product, and it is the reference client for the Wormhole Cash Layer.

Our roadmap includes adding our own BCH SV burn address to create SV-WHC and allow for the continued operation of Wormhole on Bitcoin SV. We believe in the work performed by the hard working team behind Wormhole, nChain, BMG, and Coingeek and feel that together we can make Wormhole function as a valuable token proposal on Bitcoin SV. We feel Dr Craig Wright's above communication is simply outlining his views due to his competiting academic papers and widely respected patents. It is our opinion that he feels there may be a better solution. That may very well be; however, until given the direct request to halt work on this project, we'll continue as Tokens on Bitcoin are highly needed for the future growth of BCH.


What is Bitcoin Cash
--------------------
Bitcoin Cash is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash was enhanced during and after the hashwars of November 2018. Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same transaction history up until the split in August. Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC share the same transaction history up until the hard fork in mid November (TBA).

What is the Omni Layer
----------------------
The Omni Layer is a communications protocol that uses the Bitcoin block chain to enable features such as smart contracts, user currencies and decentralized peer-to-peer exchanges. A common analogy that is used to describe the relation of the Omni Layer to Bitcoin is that of HTTP to TCP/IP: HTTP, like the Omni Layer, is the application layer to the more fundamental transport and internet layer of TCP/IP, like Bitcoin.
