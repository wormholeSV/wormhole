Bitcoin SV
=====================

Setup
---------------------
Bitcoin SV is an implementation of a node for the Bitcoin Cash network and 
builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and stores the entire history of 
Bitcoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of 
your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere 
from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Bitcoin SV, visit [bitcoinsv.io](https://bitcoinsv.io/).

Running
---------------------
Bitcoin SV is only supported on the Unix platform at this time.

To run Bitcoin SV, unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/bitcoind` (headless)
